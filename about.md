## Goals

- Be *modular* and *unobtrusive* when creating a project, allowing the team to add it to an existing project without breaking any existing component.
- Be used as a starter and add customization on top of it. This isn't a full framework.

## FAQs

### Why not just use Skeleton or Primer?

- We want to build something that is helpful to us, but at the same time available to anyone.
- The experience of maintaining and developing a kind-of-framework is increasing our knowledge of CSS, Sass, and the web in general.
